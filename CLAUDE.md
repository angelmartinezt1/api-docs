# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an API documentation repository (`api-docs`) that appears to be in early development stages. The repository currently contains minimal structure with only a basic README.md file.

## Current Structure

- Repository is initialized with git
- Main branch: `main`
- Single initial commit (31fdafe)
- Minimal content structure

## Development Notes

Since this is a new repository with minimal structure, future development may involve:
- Setting up documentation tooling (e.g., OpenAPI/Swagger, GitBook, MkDocs, etc.)
- Establishing build/deployment processes
- Adding API specification files

This CLAUDE.md should be updated as the project structure and tooling are established.
